## __Important Changes__
### __NPM Scripts__:
(old) -> (new)
```
server-dev  ->  start
react-dev   ->  build
```

### __Express Server__:
Now serves files from the public folder (__localhost:3001/__) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - instead of - <br>
public/dist (__localhost:3001/dist/__)

### __CSS__:
Implemented CSS via CSS modules so styles.css will no longer need to be linked in html file.
